## Interests

My current interests lie at the intersection of applied machine learning, natural language processing, and infrastructure optimization. I'm particularly drawn to:

- Leveraging **large language models** for automation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and enterprise analytics  
- Applying **time series and survival analysis** to operational forecasting problems (e.g., pipe failure, insurance payouts)  
- Building robust **data pipelines** with an emphasis on model monitoring and retraining  
- Exploring **semantic search and clustering** to make unstructured data more actionable  
- Researching the link between **text disclosure and financial outcomes** using NLP and statistical modeling

## Featured Projects

- **Tennis Analytics** â€“ Scraped data for 80,000 matches from ATP website and built a win predictor model  
- **Running Injury Prediction** - Trained a variety of models to predict injury for runners based on workout
