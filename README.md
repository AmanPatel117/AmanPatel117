## Interests

My current interests lie at the intersection of applied machine learning, natural language processing, and infrastructure optimization. I'm particularly drawn to:

- Leveraging **large language models** for automation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and enterprise analytics  
- Applying **time series and survival analysis** to operational forecasting problems (e.g., pipe failure, insurance payouts)  
- Building robust **data pipelines** with an emphasis on model monitoring and retraining  
- Exploring **semantic search and clustering** to make unstructured data more actionable  
- Researching the link between **text disclosure and financial outcomes** using NLP and statistical modeling

## Featured Projects

- **LLM Automation Suite** – Custom LangChain tools for analytics and prospecting  
- **RAG Pipeline for SERFF** – LlamaIndex Q&A engine for insurance filings  
- **EV Driving Simulation** – LSTM-based behavior model improving battery efficiency
