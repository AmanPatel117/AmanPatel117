<h1 align="center">Aman Patel</h1>


I'm a graduate student in **Data Science** at Georgia Tech with a strong foundation in **Mathematics** and a passion for building machine learning systems that solve real-world problems. I combine academic research with hands-on industry experience in areas like LLMs, semantic search, time series forecasting, and predictive modeling.

## Interests

My current interests lie at the intersection of applied machine learning, natural language processing, and infrastructure optimization. I'm particularly drawn to:

- Leveraging **large language models** for automation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and enterprise analytics  
- Applying **time series and survival analysis** to operational forecasting problems (e.g., pipe failure, insurance payouts)  
- Building robust **data pipelines** with an emphasis on model monitoring and retraining  
- Exploring **semantic search and clustering** to make unstructured data more actionable  
- Researching the link between **text disclosure and financial outcomes** using NLP and statistical modeling
